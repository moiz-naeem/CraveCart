# CraveCart 🍔

CraveCart is a food ordering application and my first project built with React. It uses Swiggy's public API to provide a list of restaurants and menus based on user-selected cities. While this project doesn't follow industry best practices, it serves as a reflection of my early journey into React development.

## Features 🚀

- **City Selection:** Dropdown menu for selecting cities where Swiggy operates.
- **Restaurant Listings:** Displays local restaurant partners based on the selected city.
- **Menu View:** Users can browse a restaurant’s menu.
- **Search Functionality:** Search for restaurants or specific menu items.
- **Shimmer UI:** Enhances user experience with skeleton loading animations for restaurants and menu items.
- **State Management:** Implemented using Redux for better data handling.
- **API Calls:** Axios is used for efficient communication with Swiggy’s public API.
- **Routing:** React Router DOM is used for seamless navigation.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS ensures a clean and responsive design.
